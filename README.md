## Instructions
The exercise is made of a mandatory part, the [Minimum Valuable Product](#mvp), and [bonus features](#features-bonus) to make the most of your remaining time and stand out.\
The stories have no acceptance criteria, it's up to you to define them after your functional analysis of the story.

**If you are missing some information, make a choice and stick to it.**

### Constraints
- Spring-boot 3.x.x
- Java 21
- Git
- Enhance this `README.md` file -- _Explains the potential intricacies of your implementation and how to launch your project_.

### Delivery
The code should be available in an accessible git repo ( github, gitlab ...).

### Assessment
**There is no "right" way to do this exercise.**\
We are interested in your implementation choices, your technique, the code architecture and the compliance with the constraints.\
_Also pay attention to the size of your commits and their messages._

### Tips
To quickly create your project base, use [spring initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
